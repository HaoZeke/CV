  abstract        = {Structural analyses are an integral part of computational
                  research on nucleation and supercooled water, whose accuracy
                  and efficiency can impact the validity and feasibility of such
                  studies. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these often
                  elusive and computationally expensive processes can be
                  inferred from the evolution of ice-like structures, determined
                  using appropriate structural analysis techniques. We present
                  d-SEAMS, a free and open-source post-processing engine for the
                  analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories, which is
                  specifically able to qualitatively classify ice structures, in
                  both strong confinement and bulk systems. For the first time,
                  recent algorithms for confined ice structure determination
                  have been implemented, along with topological network criteria
                  for bulk ice structure determination. We also propose and
                  validate a new order parameter for identifying the building
                  blocks of quasi-two-dimensional ice. Recognizing the need for
                  customization in structural analysis, d-SEAMS has a unique
                  code architecture, built with nix, employing a YAML-Lua
                  scripting pipeline. The software has been designed to be
                  user-friendly and extensible. The engine outputs are
                  compatible with popular graphics software suites, allowing for
                  immediate visual insights into the systems studied. We
                  demonstrate the features of d-SEAMS by using it to analyze
                  nucleation in the bulk regime and for quasi-one and
                  quasi-two-dimensional systems. Structural time evolution and
                  quantitative metrics are determined for heterogenous ice
                  nucleation on a silver-exposed b-AgI surface, homogenous ice
                  nucleation, flat monolayer square ice formation and freezing
                  of an ice nanotube.},

  abstract        = {In this work, we have considered the crystallisation
                  behaviour of supercooled water in the presence of surface
                  defects of varying size (surface fraction, α from 1 to 0.5).
                  Ice nucleation on Ag exposed βAgI (0001 plane) surface is
                  investigated by molecular dynamics simulation at a temperature
                  of 240 K. For systems with α {$>$} 0.67, the surface layers
                  crystallise within 150 ns. In the system with defects, we
                  observe two distinct stacking patterns in the layers near the
                  surface and find that systems with AA stacking cause a
                  monotonic decrease in the early nucleation dynamics with an
                  increase in defect size. Where AB stacking (α = 0.833) is
                  observed, the effect of the defect is diminished and the
                  dynamics are similar to the plain AgI surface. This is
                  supported by the variation in the orientational dynamics,
                  hydrogen bond network stability, and tetrahedrality with
                  respect to the defects. We quantify results in terms of the
                  network topology using double-diamond cages (DDCs) and
                  hexagonal cages (HCs). The configurations of the initially
                  formed layers of ice strongly affect the subsequent growth
                  even at long timescales. We assert that the retarded ice
                  growth due to defects can be explained by the relative
                  increase in DDCs with respect to HCs.},

                  self-propelled Janus probe in crowded environments. The
                  crowding is caused by the presence of viscoelastic polymers or
                  non- viscoelastic disconnected monomers. Our simulations show
                  that the translational, as well as rotational mean square
                  displacements, have a distinctive three-step growth for fixed
                  values of self-propulsion force, and steadily increase with
                  self-propulsion, irrespective of the nature of the crowder. On
                  the other hand, in the absence of crowders, the rotational
                  dynamics of the Janus probe is independent of self-propulsion
                  force. On replacing the repulsive polymers with sticky ones,
                  translational and rotational mean square displacements of the
                  Janus probe show a sharp drop. Since different faces of a
                  Janus particle interact differently with the environment, we
                  show that the direction of self-propulsion also affects its
                  dynamics. The ratio of long-time translational and rotational
                  diffusivities of the self-propelled probe with a fixed
                  self-propulsion, when plotted against the area fraction of the
                  crowders, passes through a minima and at higher area fraction
                  merges to its value in the absence of the crowder. This points
                  towards the decoupling of translational and rotational
                  dynamics of the self-propelled probe at intermediate area
                  fraction of the crowders. However, such
                  translational-rotational decoupling is absent for passive
                  probes.},
