  abstract        = {For semi classical lasing, the FDTD (finite difference time
                  domain) formulation including nonlinearities is often used. We
                  determine the computational efficiency of such schemes
                  quantitatively and present a hueristic based on space filling
                  curves to minimize complexity. The sparse matrix kernel is
                  shown to be optimized by the utilization of Bi-directional
                  Incremental Compressed Row Storage (BICRS). Extensions to high
                  performance clusters and parallelization are also derived.},
