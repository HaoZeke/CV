                  Defects},
  issn            = {0026-8976, 1362-3028},

  abstract        = {In this work, we have considered the crystallisation
                  behaviour of supercooled water in the presence of surface
                  defects of varying size (surface fraction, α from 1 to 0.5).
                  Ice nucleation on Ag exposed βAgI (0001 plane) surface is
                  investigated by molecular dynamics simulation at a temperature
                  of 240 K. For systems with α {$>$} 0.67, the surface layers
                  crystallise within 150 ns. In the system with defects, we
                  observe two distinct stacking patterns in the layers near the
                  surface and find that systems with AA stacking cause a
                  monotonic decrease in the early nucleation dynamics with an
                  increase in defect size. Where AB stacking (α = 0.833) is
                  observed, the effect of the defect is diminished and the
                  dynamics are similar to the plain AgI surface. This is
                  supported by the variation in the orientational dynamics,
                  hydrogen bond network stability, and tetrahedrality with
                  respect to the defects. We quantify results in terms of the
                  network topology using double-diamond cages (DDCs) and
                  hexagonal cages (HCs). The configurations of the initially
                  formed layers of ice strongly affect the subsequent growth
                  even at long timescales. We assert that the retarded ice
                  growth due to defects can be explained by the relative
                  increase in DDCs with respect to HCs.},
